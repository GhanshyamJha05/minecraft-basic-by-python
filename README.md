# Minecraft Using Python 

A high-performance Minecraft-like voxel game built with Python and the Ursina game engine. This project features procedural terrain generation with OpenSimplex noise, a survival-style HUD, and an optimized mesh-based rendering system.

## 🚀 Recent Performance & Gameplay Updates

- **Optimized Mesh Rendering**: Implemented **Face Culling**—only rendering block faces exposed to air. This drastically reduces the polygon count and maximizes FPS.
- **Survival HUD**: Added a modern UI featuring real-time **Health** and **Stamina** bars.
- **Advanced Movement**: 
  - **Sprinting**: Pressing `Shift` increases speed but drains the Stamina bar.
  - **Recovery**: Stamina regenerates automatically when not sprinting.
  - **Smooth Transitions**: Implemented Linear Interpolation (Lerp) for natural speed changes.
- **Visual Polish**: 
  - **Procedural Clouds**: Dynamic clouds randomly generated in the sky.
  - **Atmospheric Fog**: Enhanced distance fog for depth and immersion.
- **Improved Interaction**: Refined block placement and destruction using hit normals for pixel-perfect accuracy.
- **Inventory Management**: 
  - **Interactive Hotbar**: Switch between items using keys `1-5` or the **Scroll Wheel**.
  - **Storage Inventory (E)**: A full-screen menu to manage block assignments and view all available materials.
  - **Dynamic Hand Updates**: The player's held block updates visually based on the current selection.

## ✨ Features

- **Procedural Terrain**: OpenSimplex noise-driven landscape generation (hills, valleys, plains).
- **Survival Mechanics**: Health management and a dynamic stamina system for sprinting.
- **Optimized Subsets**: One mesh entity per block type for efficient rendering and texturing.
- **Interactive Environment**: Real-time world manipulation (Place/Destroy).
- **Visuals**: Day-time skybox, moving clouds, and vertex-colored terrain.
- **Inventory System**: Hotbar-based selection and a detailed management UI.
- **FPS Counter**: Built-in monitor to track performance.
